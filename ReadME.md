# Working with PDFs

This is another fun project to operate on PDFs. PDF, Portable Document Format Files are used to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems. This makes them a popular choice and hence widely used. This project aims at customizing PDFs as per user's requirement i.e. Splitting PDF, Merging PDFs, Converting PDFs to doc/docx, Extracting Text, PDFs to Images and much more, using simple Python Scripts.

## Getting Started
